5. Features / Highlights
Business Problem
Zomato needs to identify why certain regions are underperforming and address a significant gap between customer acquisition and customer churn. Without a centralized view, it is difficult to see which age groups or cities are driving the most value.

6.Goal of the Dashboard
Track Revenue: Monitor total sales amount (987M) and order volume (150K).

Analyze Retention: Visualize the "Gain vs. Lost" customer ratio to improve loyalty programs.

Geographic Analysis: Identify top-performing cities like Tirupati and Bikaner to scale successful local strategies.

Demographic Targeting: Pinpoint the core user age group (20–30 years) for targeted advertising.
